## MY ROLE
I'm highly interested in understanding real applications of emerging technologies. As a **Product Manager**, I conducted **market analysis** to find a potential niche where AI can solve a recurring problem efficiently, and quickly built a **Proof of Concept (POC)** to get feedback on the **value proposition**. Then, defined a **Roadmap** to scale this product based on the feedback and the **Product Strategy**.

- As a personal project, I have validated that by following the Agile framework, I can quickly define, prototype, and test an idea to get real-user feedback.
- Having a user-centric approach is key to launching successful products.
- Collaborating with a Designer on the wireframe is crucial in translating a product vision into a tangible design, emphasizing the importance of functionality and aesthetics.
- Building a prototype using a no-code app is a practical choice for quick iteration and testing, showcasing adaptability and efficiency in the development process.
- The testing phase with actual users adds a valuable feedback loop to refine further and improve the product.

## ROADMAP
This is a visual representation of how to develop the product iteratively, how to include customer feedback in the early stages, and when to work with potential partnerships as high-quality leads.
