## MY ROLE
I'm highly interested in understanding real applications of emerging technologies. As a **Product Manager**, I conducted **market analysis** to find a potential niche where AI can solve a recurring problem efficiently, and quickly built a **Proof of Concept (POC)** to get feedback on the **value proposition**. Then, based on the feedback and the **Product Strategy**, defined the **Product Roadmap**.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS
- As a personal project, I have had the amazing experience of working and developing first-hand using OpenAI's APIs. Their growth has been exponential, allowing more business cases to be discovered. 
- Getting feedback in each stage is essential to validate your idea, and ensure you work in a valuable, payable, and consumable solution.
- Defining a Roadmap is great for sharing your vision with others. With a clear direction, the decision-making process is faster and keeps everybody motivated and working toward the same goals.
- A lesson learned is to clearly **define success metrics** from the very beginning is essential to keep yourself on track when prioritizing

## POC with "Friends&Family" and Linkedin community
I have released a **free, limited-access version** to get feedback ASAP on the core features (idea analysis and shareable presentation). By skipping the user interface at this stage, the delivery time was reduced significantly.

## ROADMAP
This is a visual representation of how to develop the product iteratively, how to include customer feedback in the early stages, and when to work with potential partnerships as high-quality leads.
