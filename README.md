## MY ROLE
I'm highly interested in understanding real applications of emerging technologies. As a **Product Manager**, I conducted **market analysis** to find a potential niche where AI can solve a recurring problem efficiently. I quickly built a **Proof of Concept (POC)** to get feedback on the **value proposition**. Then, based on the feedback and the **Product Strategy**, the **Product Roadmap** was defined.

## PRODUCT
Accelerate your time-to-market with **OnlyFounders.AI**, a web app designed to help entrepreneurs validate and refine business ideas quickly and cost-effectively. 

1. **Key items:** Our AI model is trained with frameworks, methodologies, and business cases so that you can focus on execution. The Current version generates up to 14 key concepts, including product strategy, cost structure, cross-sell potential, clear value proposition, and more. This will be extended up to 31 items in the next iteration. 

2. **Cost and Time Efficient:** With the latest advances, instead of weeks with several experts, we can get (almost) the same result for less than **5 USD in less than 2 minutes**. 

3. **Sharable Results:** OnlyFunders app generates a Google Slide presentation with the results so you can easily review it, adjust it, and quickly share without installing anything.

## POC with "Friends&Family" and Linkedin community
I have released a **free, limited-access version** to get feedback ASAP on the core features (idea analysis and shareable presentation). By skipping the user interface at this stage, the delivery time was reduced significantly.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS
- As a personal project, I have had amazing first-hand experience working and developing using OpenAI's APIs. Their growth has been exponential, allowing more business cases to be discovered. 
- Getting feedback in each stage is essential to validate your idea, and ensure your work is a valuable, payable, and useful solution.
- Defining a Roadmap is great for sharing your vision with others. With a clear direction, the decision-making process is faster and keeps everybody motivated and working toward the same goals.
- A lesson learned is that clearly **defining success metrics** from the very beginning is essential to keeping yourself on track when prioritizing



## ROADMAP
This is a visual representation of how to develop the product iteratively, how to include customer feedback in the early stages, and when to work with potential partnerships as high-quality leads.

Feedback comments
1. Hey Robin, I tried it, and it made at least a week and a half of work in less than one minute! I wonder how much it cost, if I might ask.
1A Hello! We OpenAI's recent update, the token price has dropped a lot. I just checked, and your request cost less than 0,10 USD. 
2. Hello! Great way to try out AI capabilities in real business applications! Thanks for the free access! 
2.A You're welcome! I will keep using it for future side projects. 
3. Hey Robin! What I like the most is that it generates a full presentation with the result and is easy to update! Is selecting the slide template possible?
4. Hey, great tool! The interface is weird; I had some issues with the permissions, but having the presentation at the end is super useful.
